https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fUxZUphi-jLd_IjgwhZ1oOfeJVX88INZ?usp=sharing

Basically we are working on xkl to built it with GTK, just for remember
xkl file i am sharing in google drive.


Now only time and audio and file menu some entries are pending

I am providing Zipcode V20 contains complete menu of Spectrogram, all entries completed and working properly, also few entries of Time menu also working, Next task is to Implement Time entries from 3 to onwards.
you please run orignal xkl in Linux and see

Now our goal is Time menu and Audio menu, file menu
Even in time menu few entries already working
In that 20 version prev dev was working on Time menu and only last 6 entries are pending
So at First Step you can please use GTK, and Visual Studio to complete Time menu last 6 entries working and make its version V21
and after completing V21, Please do share me complete folder of code VS in Zip, that will be our V21
than we will move to Audio menu that is pending and we need to make its V22 version
Audio menu total are 5 entries and at this moment all are pending
File menu only First entry work that take audio as input, other are pending
So you have to complete time menu entrys work, audio menu entries working, and then file menu as priority.
